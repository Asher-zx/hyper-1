# Tiny simply API

Experimenting with HTTP verbs and status codes.

After cloning thr project, you need to run:\
`npm i`

Then you start it (with auto reload), by running:\
`npm run watch`

You can now call the api, for example by calling:\
`http://localhost:3000/animals/all/mood`

(with a browser or some API test tool like [Bruno](https://www.usebruno.com/), [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) or [Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client))
